Choosing your first guitar is a big step when starting lessons — and with so many choices, it can feel overwhelming. Here's a simple guide to help you find the right fit so you can focus on learning and having fun.

## Acoustic vs. Electric: Which One Should You Choose?

**Acoustic Guitars:**  
Perfect for beginners who want to master basic techniques without needing extra gear like an amplifier. Acoustic guitars have a natural, rich sound that’s great for solo practice or jamming with friends.  
Learn more about [why acoustic guitars are great for beginners](https://www.guitarworld.com/learn/why-acoustic-guitar-perfect-beginners).

**Electric Guitars:**  
If you're drawn to rock, metal, or music that requires lots of effects, an electric guitar might suit you better. Just remember: you'll need an amplifier too, which adds a little more to the setup.  
Here’s a helpful guide to [choosing the right electric guitar](https://www.guitarcenter.com/riffs/choosing-electric-guitar).

## The Right Size for You

If you’re an adult student, a full-sized guitar will likely be the most comfortable.  
However, if you want something a little easier to handle, a 3/4-size acoustic guitar could be a great option.  
The key is that the guitar feels good in your hands — comfort makes learning so much easier!

## What to Look for in Your First Guitar

- **Build Quality:** Look for a guitar that feels solid and produces a clean, rich tone. You don’t have to break the bank, but avoid flimsy models.
- **Price:** Starting out, you don’t need an expensive guitar. Find a good-quality option that fits your budget and inspires you to play.
